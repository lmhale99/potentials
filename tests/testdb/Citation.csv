Fitting ab initio compound data does not ensure correct reproduction of the dilute solid-solution formation energy, and explicit inclusion of this quantity in the potential development procedure does not guarantee that the potential will predict the correct solid–liquid phase diagram. Therefore, we conclude that fitting only to solid phase properties, as is done in most potential development procedures, generally is not sufficient to develop a semi-empirical potential suitable for the simulation of solidification. A method is proposed for the incorporation of data for liquid solution energies in the potential development procedure, and a new semi-empirical potential developed suitable for simulations of dilute alloys of Mg in Al. The potential correctly reproduces both zero-temperature solid properties and solidus and liquid lines on the Al-rich part of the Al–Mg phase diagram.",3269-3285,10.1080/14786430903260727,,"@article{2009--Mendelev-M-I-Asta-M-Rahman-M-J-Hoyt-J-J,

Atomistic modeling can be a useful tool to assess these behaviors. However, this can be difficult due to the lack of fidelity of the interatomic potentials in reproducing this high pressure and temperature extreme behavior. Here, a hybrid EAM-R—which is the combination of embedded atom method (EAM) and rapid artificial neural network potential—for Tin (Sn) is described which is capable of accurately modeling the complex sequence of phase transitions between different metallic polymorphs as a function of pressure. This hybrid approach ensures that a basic empirical potential like EAM is used as a lower energy bound. By using the final activation function, the neural network contribution to energy must be positive, assuring stability over the whole configuration space. This implementation has the capacity to reproduce density functional theory results at 6 orders of magnitude slower than a pair potential for molecular dynamics simulation, including elastic and plastic characteristics and relative energies of each phase. Using calculations of the Gibbs free energy, it is demonstrated that the potential precisely predicts the experimentally observed phase changes at temperatures and pressures across the whole phase diagram. At 10.2 GPa, the present potential predicts a first-order phase transition between body-centered tetragonal (BCT) β-Sn and another polymorph of BCT-Sn. This structure transforms into body-centered cubic near the experimentally reported value at 33 GPa. Thus, the Sn potential developed in this paper can be used to study complex deformation mechanisms under extreme conditions of high pressure and strain rates unlike existing potentials. Moreover, the framework developed in this paper can be extended for different material systems with complex phase diagrams.",043601,10.1103/physrevmaterials.7.043601,,"@article{2023--Nitol-M-S-Dang-K-Fensin-S-J-et-al,
