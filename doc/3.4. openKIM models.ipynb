    "The advantage of KIM models is that they exist as installed code and therefore the computed energies and forces will be the same regardless of the simulator software (e.g. LAMMPS) in which the model is used.  The setup does introduce some additional complexity resulting in KIM needing their own version control, which extends to the models themselves.  Only certain versions of a KIM model are compatible with a version of the kim-api, and only certain versions of the kim-api are compatible with a version of LAMMPS.  Because of this, it is impractical to include all KIM model versions as separate entries and instead the list should only include models that are currently installed with the particular LAMMPS+kim-api that is to be used.\n",
