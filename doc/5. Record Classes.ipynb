    "This Notebook provides a general overview of the Record subclasses and outlines the common methods and attributes that they share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potentials package is designed to interact with different types of data, which are referred to as \"record styles\".  Each style has its own Record subclass, and is associated with a particular data model schema. As style-subclass-schema are all uniquely linked, the terms may be used interchangeably in this documentation even if they are not technically equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Record subclasses are designed to allow for users to interact with the data in three primary representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"python\" representation interprets data fields as class attributes that can be directly accessed and (for most styles) modified.  This allows for data entries to be examined and created without the user needing to know the underlying schema.  It also allows for the Record class to have built-in methods and attributes that use the data in meaningful ways.\n",
    "- The \"data model\" representation corresponds to the database entry schema associated with that style of record, which is equivalently represented in JSON and XML.  Each Record class can load data model records, store the loaded data model internally, and (re)build the data model based on the current class attributes.\n",
    "- The \"metadata\" representation corresponds to a dictionary of simple metadata fields extracted from the record.  This is meant to provide a simple overview of each record which can be used for comparing and parsing.\n"
